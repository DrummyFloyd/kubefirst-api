# kubefirst-api

Kubefirst API runtime implementation.

## Updating Docs

Swagger UI is generated using [gin-swagger](https://github.com/swaggo/gin-swagger). Tagged routes will generate documentation.

Any time godoc defs for routes are changed, `swag init` should be run.

In order to generate docs:

```bash
go install github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag@latest
```

```bash
make updateswagger
```

## Swagger UI

When the app is running, the UI is available via http://:8081/swagger/index.html.

## Running Locally

The API can be run locally for testing. The api is available at `:8081/api/v1`.

## Creating a Cluster

This is in active development. As such, there are limitations.

GitHub has been tested and works. GitLab has not been tested yet so success may be spotty.

When starting the API, you have to have certain OS environment variables set in order for it to work. In the future, this won't be a requirement.

### Civo

You must have the `CIVO_TOKEN` environment variable set containing your API key.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/cluster/my-cool-cluster -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"admin_email": "scott@kubeshop.io", "cloud_provider": "civo", "cloud_region": "nyc1", "domain_name": "your-dns.io", "git_owner": "your-dns-io", "git_provider": "github", "git_token": "ghp_...", "type": "mgmt"}'
```

### Digital Ocean

You must have the `DO_TOKEN`, `DO_SPACES_KEY`, and `DO_SPACES_SECRET` environment variables set containing your API key, spaces key, and spaces secret respectively. Kubefirst does not create a Digital Ocean space for you. You must create one ahead of time and provide the key and secret when creating a Digital Ocean cluster. The space acts as an S3-compatible storage bucket for Terraform state and other cluster operations.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/cluster/my-cool-cluster -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"admin_email": "scott@kubeshop.io", "cloud_provider": "digitalocean", "cloud_region": "nyc3", "domain_name": "kubefunk.de", "git_owner": "kubefunk-de", "git_provider": "github", "git_token": "ghp_...", "type": "mgmt"}'
```

### Vultr

You must have the `VULTR_API_KEY` environment variable set containing your API key.

```bash
‚ùØ curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/cluster/my-cool-cluster -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"admin_email": "scott@kubeshop.io", "cloud_provider": "vultr", "cloud_region": "ewr", "domain_name": "kubesecond.com", "git_owner": "your-dns-io", "git_provider": "github", "git_token": "ghp_...", "type": "mgmt"}'
```
